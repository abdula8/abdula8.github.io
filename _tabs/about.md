## About Me

I’m **Abdallah Atef Eid**, a cybersecurity engineer with a passion for building and defending secure infrastructures. I specialize in **SIEM deployment**, **threat detection**, **log analysis**, and securing **cloud and on-prem environments** through practical, real-world solutions.

My journey didn’t begin with a specific degree in cybersecurity—I earned my **Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Benha University**, and my path evolved from **system administration to DevOps to defensive security**. Over time, I’ve worked with technologies ranging from **OSSIM, ELK Stack, and Kaspersky Security Center**, to **Terraform, GitLab CI/CD, and Kubernetes**—bridging the gap between IT operations and security.

I document my work, share what I learn, and continuously seek to grow through hands-on projects and community collaboration. I believe that **security is not just a job—it’s a responsibility**, and I aim to contribute to safer digital environments for teams and individuals alike.

- ☁️ Automated infrastructure deployment and secure application delivery using **Terraform on AWS**, integrated with **CI/CD pipelines**.
- 🎯 Currently preparing for **OSCP**, and completed several hands-on labs and training in **threat hunting**, **cloud security**, and **network defense**.
